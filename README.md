> üí°Ô∏èÔ∏è The WHMCS IDProtect operations are not implemented in this module: by default, all anonymization options are enforced to `true` for TLDs supporting it, whatever is specified for each individual TLD. There is no reason why privacy should be optional!

## How to install
1. In your WHCMS installation, in the `modules/registrars/`, create a `gandi` directory.
2. Download the last [release](https://github.com/Hosterra/whmcs-gandi/releases).
3. Unzip & copy all files in the `gandi` directory.
4. Make a symbolic link named `resources/domains/additionalfields.php` pointing to `modules/registrars/gandi/resources/domains/additionalfields.php`.
5. Activate the addon in the **_Setup->Domain Registrars_** section of WHMCS admin.

## How to configure

> üí°Ô∏èÔ∏è Gandi Registrar for WHMCS allows you to delegate your DNS handling to Gandi LiveDNS. To do so, you have to select "Gandi LiveDNS" in this module settings and have `livedns.gandi.net` as default name servers in WHMCS main domains config. Note `livedns.gandi.net` is not an existing host, it's just the easiest way to fill some gaps in the WHMCS APIs.

## Uncovered TLDs
All [TLDs managed by Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en/domain/tld) are registrable except the following:
- TLDs reserved for Gandi Corporate Services (see [list](resources/domains/corporateservices.php));
- TLDs that require heavy development work to be integrated into the WHMCS workflow (see [list](resources/domains/excluded.php)).
